# Libft
## Description:
These are some C standard functions that I replicated and use. The main objective is to have more control and tools to wrangle problems with limitations imposed by the norms of Hive Helsinki school.

It is also worth mentioning that my other two projects, and respectivelly the result functions, are included in this personalized library. (ft_printf() and get_next_line()).

NB: not all of the functions there are present in C standard library; some I've done for my own use as derivated functions or completely done by me for specific uses.

## Usage:
**MacOs and Linux**
- `git clone https://github.com/FjjDessoyCaraballo/Libft` into your project directory.
- Make the files/Link the Makefile to your project Makefile with a symbolic link:
```
$(LIBFT_MAKEFILE):
	@echo "Creating symbolic link for libft Makefile..."
	ln -s $(CURDIR)/$(LIBFT_MAKEFILE) $(LIBFT_MAKEFILE)
```
- Use the functions according to your needs.
- Profit $$$
